#  Dojo App - Martial Arts Training & Event Management

Hi! Welcome to Dojo App . This is a web app I built to help martial arts dojos manage their training sessions and events. Since I’ve been really into martial arts myself, I wanted to create something simple and useful that makes it easier for instructors to stay organized and for students to book their training without any hassle.

About the App

Dojo App is basically a tool to keep everything related to martial arts classes and events in one place. Whether it’s a karate dojo, a taekwondo school, or any other martial arts center, the app helps instructors manage sessions while giving students an easy way to sign up and keep track of their training.

Why I Made This

As a student, I’ve always admired martial arts and the discipline it teaches. While learning coding, I noticed that a lot of dojos still use paper sheets or spreadsheets to manage their classes. That felt outdated, so I wanted to build something more practical—while also challenging myself with a full-stack project.

With Dojo App, instructors can create regular training sessions or special events, set participant limits, and keep track of who’s joining. On the other side, students can browse sessions, book spots, and stay on top of their schedule—all from one place.
